App Description: Allows users to search up nba player's average points, rebounds, and assists per game. We also have an NBA Higher or Lower Game where two randomly selected players are given and you choose which person averages more points per game than the other in the 2024-2025 season. You earn a point for every round you get correct. You lose when you get a round incorrect. The higher or lower game has a leaderboard of all the top scorers.
